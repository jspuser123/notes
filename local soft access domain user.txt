While logged in as domain-user, use Windows Explorer to browse to C:\Users\local-user\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs You will see there the shortcuts (and folders for shortcuts) for the programs you can't find logged in as domain-user. You should be able to double-click these shortcuts to launch the programs, no harm in trying it to verify.

You can then move these shortcuts (and shortcut folders) to be available to "all users" on the laptop by moving them to the folder: C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs.

Second task, eliminate the annoying the administrator prompts.

Open Control Panel > Users > Change User Account Control settings (middle of window) --- move the slider at left all the way to the bottom "Never notify". You will be prompted for administrator credentials to confirm you want to do this.
