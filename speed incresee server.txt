if you use applications that require too much computing power to operate, you are better off replacing them with applications that do the same job as them but faster. Few resource hogging applications that you can replace are:-
1) Most resource intensive antivirus software can be replaced with the lightweight Avast free antivirus.
2) Microsoft Office (Microsoft 365) can be replaced with OpenOffice, an open source alternative that also has loads of amazing additions.
3) Adobe Reader can be replaced with the free Foxit Reader.
4) The newer versions of Internet Explorer (IE 10 and above) and Microsoft Edge are less resource intensive. If you have been using an older version, it is time to upgrade IE or replace it with either Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. This can also give you faster browsing speeds.
5) The default Windows Media Player can be replaced with the VLC Media Player.

Upgrade processor for high demand tasks
If you regularly use your computer for high demand tasks (like converting videos or playing games) and feel your computer is lagging, it is best to upgrade your CPU to a powerful one as performance in these type of tasks is directly dependent on your processor's capabilities.

Upgrade graphic card for graphic heavy applications
Graphic heavy applications need a graphic processor to perform optimally. If you regularly use graphic heavy applications that your PC lags while handling, you must upgrade your graphic card as no amount of tweaking can help you beyond a certain point.

Upgrade to a solid state HDD
Although solid state hard drives are a lot faster for writing and reading data than older optical hard drives, their high price is something that keeps them out of the range of many. Still, if you do manage to get one for your PC, the change in speed will be immediately visible.

If all else fails, get more RAM
RAM or the Random Access Memory contains files of the currently running programs that are immediately required by the computer with capacity of the RAM being the limiting factor. Accessing files from RAM is much faster than doing the same from a hard disk. This means that more the RAM you have, more the programs you can run simultaneously without compromising on speed. RAM upgrades do not cost much and are one of the best ways to speed up a slow computer.
