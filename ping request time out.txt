You should perform a power cycle to fix any possible connection error from your end.

Power off the modem, router, and other network devices connected to your LAN
Disconnect the Ethernet cables and power cables from Modem, Router, PC, etc.
Clean the cables if they are rusty and connect them back properly
Power on the devices
Disable the firewall on your machine and try to ping Google DNS address 8.8.8.8 Check whether you get the Request Timed Out again.

Try to ping 8.8.8.8 from another machine directly connected to the modem.

If you are getting intermittent Request Timed Out from the machine with direct connection to the modem, I suspect the problem is with ISP.
